## Set Up ##

To run the demo, first you need to obtain a **[Google Places](https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=androiddeveloper&passive=1209600&continue=https://play.google.com/apps/publish/&followup=https://play.google.com/apps/publish/)** API Key from their site. If you already have one, just plug it in, delete our warning message and run!

## Testing ##

To test, just enter something of interest like "burgers" or "haircuts". The app then return google places information on your query and automatically map them to objects. The results will be displayed on the map for you as a quick demo of how powerful ObjectMap really is.

## Learning More ##

Look at the very top-level README of the project to see how it all works, and how to set up your custom NSObjects from the get-go. Leave an Issue if you have any questions.
